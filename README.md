# Project_Engeto_SQL
Create new tabs, 7 sql scripts, reply research questions, add accompanying doc with full explanations

Introduction to the project
Model situation: In your analytical department of an independent company that deals with the standard of living of citizens, you have agreed to try to answer a few defined research questions that address the availability of staple foods to the general public. Colleagues have already defined the basic questions that they will try to answer and provide this information to the press department. This department will present the results at the next conference focused on this area.
To do this, they need you to prepare robust data bases in which it will be possible to see a comparison of the availability of food based on average incomes over a certain period of time.
As additional material, prepare a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period, as a primary overview for the Czech Republic.


Research questions

 1/ Are wages rising in all industries over the years, or falling in some?
 
 2/ How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data?
 
 3/ Which food category is increasing in price the slowest (has the lowest percentage year-on-year increase)?
 
 4/ Has there been a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?
 
 5/ Does the level of GDP affect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?


Project output

The output should be two tables in the database from which the required data can be obtained. Name the tables t_{name}_{surname}_project_SQL_primary_final (for wage and food price data for the Czech Republic unified for the same comparative period – common years) and t_{name}_{surname}_project_SQL_secondary_final (for additional data on other European countries).

Next, prepare a set of SQL, which will obtain the data base from the tables you have prepared to answer the set research questions. Be careful, the questions/hypotheses can support or refute your output! It depends on what the data says.
Create a repository on your GitHub account (it can be private) where you store all the information about the project - mainly the SQL script generating the result table, the description of the intermediate results (the accompanying list) and information about the output data (for example, where values ​​are missing, etc.).
